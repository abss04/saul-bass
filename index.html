        <p>Saul Bass saw beauty in the ordinary. He is one of the most influential graphic designers and filmmakers of the 20th century.  He is recognised for his impressive work throughout his career which helped shape the future of design. His work is a reflection of his philosophy which developed and evolved as his work matured, pushing the boundaries of graphic design through visually storytelling. Bass’s philosophy follows the idea that “design is thinking made visual”.  He believes that art has the power to change society in communicating a message directly and efficiently. I want to explore and investigate how Bass’s philosophy evolved throughout his career. </p>

        <h2 id="early-career">Early Career</h2>
    
        <p>To understand where Bass’s philosophy transpired from, I wanted to look at his early career. Bass was born in Bronx in 1920 to Eastern European Jewish immigrants, he took classes at the Art Students League before transferring to Brooklyn College where his tutor Gygorgy Kepes, a Hungarian graphic designer who became a huge inspiration for Bass throughout his career,  introduced Bass to László Moholy-Nagy’s Bauhaus style and Russian constructivism while teaching him that an effective design doesn’t have to conform to societal values. In 1946 Bass designed motion picture title sequences, corporate logos and movie posters until he migrated to Los Angeles in 1947 which created lots of career opportunities for him. After studying, he did freelance work for multiple companies and agencies including Warner Bros. Bass enjoyed simplicity, hand-drawn shapes and the art of minimalism, his early work of graphic posters and advertising utilized clean lines and bold colours to attract attention enabling effective communication of key ideas. Bass had a refined colour palette as his was drawn to minimalism he would only ever use three or four colours in his designs, making them more refined. His golden colour combination was red, white and black, the red being the striking colour which was always recognised and memorable. Bass also possessed a distinctive typography style which favoured rough, hand drawn words, usually in all-caps. This gave a powerful depiction without becoming overbearing which tied in nicely with his colour palette. </p>
        
        <p>Bass’s philosophy in his early career focuses on the visual abstraction and symbolism as he aspired to create designed that were more intellectually engaging as he recognized how images surpass language barriers enabling communication on a universal level. He wanted his designs to visually communicate powerful meanings through minimal elements and emotionally resonant illustrations.  </p>

        <h3 id="mid-career">Mid Career</h3>

    <p>Bass’s mid-career is where he started to make a name for himself and his confidence grew within his designs. Bass started his own practice in 1952 before establishing his private firm as Saul Bass and Associates a few years later, he began revolutionizing title sequences by collaborating with filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Otto Preminger, and Stanley Kubrick. After being offered a job by the filmmaker Otto Preminger to design a poster for Carmen Jones Bass altered movie title sequences from static credits into dynamic, thematic introductions. Bass work was developing as he was establishing himself in the design industry. He said “I had felt for some time that audience involvement with a film should begin with the first frame.” This was revolutionary, artists were looking at the world of design differently as the first frame of films became an excitement to watch as they unfolded snippets of what’s to come, deepening the viewer’s emotional connection with the film and setting the entire mood and tone of the film right from the start. </p>

    <p>Bass is renowned for his ability to collaborate effectively as he worked with lots of different artists and directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Martin Scorsese. Bass believed that the best ideas can come from various viewpoints as he took on an open dialogue environment. He once said, “interesting things happen when the creative impulse is cultivated with curiosity, freedom and intensity”. Working with so many different designers allowed Bass to get more insight to different perspectives which helped his work develop as the creativity was endless which was exciting not only for Bass but for all fields of graphic design, filmmaking, and visual communication. His collaborations highlighted his ability to fuse art with narrative which made his philosophy of design greatly inspirational to both designers and filmmakers.  </p>

    <P>His philosophy developed focusing on storytelling as his work had evolved from pure function to narrative integration. Bass sought to create an emotional and psychological experience for the audience. He wanted his work to resonate with the viewers be connected with what was happening on screen. </P>

    <p>One of my favourite film designs Bass created was the iconic ‘The Man With The Golden Arm’. Bass reinvented movie title sequences through minimalist approach and controversial idea at the time. Bass was able to encapsulate a visual representation of the movies essence and style with him symbolic elements. The film told the story of an aspiring jazz drummer who battles with addiction. Bass took on the challenge of finding a symbol to expose the cruelty of addiction without sensationalism. Using a powerful image of a black distorted arm reaching down towards addiction was a completely unconventional approach to design which revolutionised the way people thought. Bass captures the drama and intensity of the film through the simple geometric shapes, block colours and symbolism. </p>

        <h3 id="later-career">Later Career</h3>

    <p>Bass went on to create notable logos for major corporations, including AT&T, United Airlines, and Warner Communications, believing was more than a symbol it portrayed a story. The average lifespan of one of his logos in 34 years with some of his work yet to be replaced, he designed over 30 corporate logos and directed 11 films between 1962 and 83. Bass pursued timeless designs that have the ability to capture a brand’s essence. You can see this in his AT&T “Globe” logo which symbolized connectivity and modernism through the use of essential elements. In Bass’s later career his work emulates a more direct engagement with social, political and cultural issues, reflecting a deeper understanding of the impact of art and design on the world, the influence it has on public perception and social values as he investigated deeper themes of identity, morality, and human conflict within his design for films such as Exodus (1960) and Anatomy of a Murder (1959). Bass focused on how he could use design as a tool for communication and social change. </p>

    <h3 id="late-reflection">Late Reflection</h3>
    
    <p>It’s noticeable in Bass’s later work such as Scorsese his growth and development from animated collage to computer graphics. Comparing to his earlier work where he made use of materials at the time such as collage, white space and colour, it’s much more mature as his knowledge and skills evolved. He focused more on mentorship and building a legacy instead of active design work. He wanted to share his knowledge and values and in his final years, Bass expressed his thoughts that great design represents time and culture as it’s a universal language that evokes emotional and an intellectual response. It’s not purely focused on aesthetics but can bring clarity to complex ideas through communication. He once said “if it's simple simple, it's boring. We try for the idea that is so simple that it will make you think and rethink” this is the epitome of his philosophy where he combined simplicity with symbolism and visually communicating to create dynamic and inspiring designs. </p>
    
    <p>Thus my mother and I ambled along the two sunny sides of Market Square, guiding our broken shadows along the houses as over a keyboard. Under our soft steps the squares of the paving stones slowly filed past — some the pale pink of human skin, some golden, some blue-grey, all flat, warm and velvety in the sun, like sundials, trodden to the point of obliteration, into blessed nothingness.</p>

    <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

    <p>The evolution of Bass’s work predicts his legacy as one of the most influential designers of the 20th century as he developed from functional clarity to narrative storytelling and then to cultural identity. His work follows four core principles which he employed throughout. The first being simplicity, Bass refined complex ideas into dynamic, accessible forms which made his work intellectually engaging as he recognized how images surpass language barriers enabling communication on a universal level. Functionality played a key role in his work as he believed design must serve a purpose, either delivering a message/story or shaping a brand. The principle of Emotional Engagement involved connecting with audiences through meaningful, suggestive visuals. Bass articulated his ideas through symbolism and metaphors which gave the audience insight as to what to expect and finally timelessness. This meant designs that will be distinctive, memorable and relevant through decades. Bass was known for constantly exploring new ideas, techniques and perspectives which made his work more diverse and allowing for his work to remain interesting and new. He will continue to be iconic through his designs as his innovative approach to visual communication and design is so influential. </p>
